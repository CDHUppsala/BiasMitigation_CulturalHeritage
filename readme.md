## Quantifying Culture: AI and Heritage Collections - Bias mitigation techniques in image classification algorithms

This repository contains the evaluation of bias mitigation techniques in a gender image classification task. We used Xception and EfficientNet as deep neural networks; accuracy, demographic parity difference, proportional parity difference, equality of opportunity and predictive rate parity difference as evaluation metrics; and threshold change, class reweighting and image augmentation as bias mitigation methods. We evaluated the effectiveness of the bias mitigation pipeline on a cultural heritage collection of photographs from the 19th and 20th centuries, and we used the FairFace data set for the transfer learning experiments.
